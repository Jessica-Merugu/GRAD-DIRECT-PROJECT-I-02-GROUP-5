## Abstract

> Identifying and spotting a criminal is a time-consuming and difficult process.Criminals are becoming smarter by not leaving biological evidence or fingerprint impressions at crime scenes. 
using cutting-edge face recognition systems is a simple and quicksolution.Cameras are being installed at most building structures as well as traffic lights for military surveillance since safety technology evolves.The sensor video footage can be used to identify suspects, criminals, runaways, and missing people,among other things.Â 


##Overview of Face Recognition Methodology

1. Face Detection: The task of detection images surrounding it using bounding boxes an d cropping out uncessary parts of the image. The detection process is the foundtion for further  tasks as the face cannot be identified before it is recognised. An image can contain more than one phase. This step is acheived using various detection techniques.MTCNN was directly implemented MTCNN library. All images are loaded as numpy array and converted to RGB files.Face

2. Face Embedding: Face embeddings need to be created so comparisions with different vectors acn be done.This is the step where the FaceNet model was used for creating embeddings. After loading the compressed file of detected faces the  pixel  values need to be standardized as it is required for FaceNet.

3. Face Classification: In this part of the process, embeddings are classified  using machine learning models to be identified as one of the criminals. Before applying a classification, model vector normalization is applied so values are scaled. The  scikit  learn normalization library is used for this  purpose. Next,  the names of the criminals are converted from string to integer format. This is done using LabelEncoder of scikit learn. The classification model used is Linear  Support  Vector Machine as it is effective for differentiating between the face embeddings. The linear SVM model is fit on the training data.

4.Plotting Face: To visualize the working of this entire model a face from the compressed test set is picked. Then embeddings for this image are created. This face embedding is  used as input to  fit in the model and get predictions.
