> -In our daily lives, humans perform face identification routinely and effortlessly. The process of identifying a person's face is divided into four stages. First, the system recognizes the user's face. Second, the person's face will be compared to other faces in the system's database. Finally, the output identifies who the detected person is after comparison.
